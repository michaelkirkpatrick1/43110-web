<p>At the start on my month i travled to denver to kick back and climb with some of my closest friends. The trip was a much needed escape from the busy school and city life which had been my reality. This was my first expirence travling far west and it did not dissapiont. The beautiful rocky mountian backdrop greats you at the exit of the massive and complex maybe illumaniti controlled denver airport is a sight to see and really put alot in persective. When around such impreesive feats of mother nature you truly feel your size, its humbling to feel like a small speck in a huge domaine something that often evades city life. We spent most of our time in Denver rock climbing as that was our mission from the start. Climbing is what bases us, its mental and physical toal has conncted a deep emotional qulity to the activity which i try not to overlook. I use the sport as a mental refresher forgetting the perrals of the real world at the door and fulling commiting to the wall. This is maybe what I learned most from reflecting on denver, the role of climbing in my life. - Michael Kirkpatrick</p>
