<p>For easter break I travled to London to catch up with family and friends. I had been to london once before but i was pretty young at the time, and now with my brother living in the city i knew my view of London was set to change. This trip was also a reunion of sorts as I was to meet up with both of my siblings and a collection of super close family frineds, we had all grown up togther on the same street. London Town is beautiful, as The architecture clashes from ancient to modern and everthing in between. It was super cool to see the age of the city a perspective that is lost in many american cities. Cant wait to head back, its only a matter of time. </p>
